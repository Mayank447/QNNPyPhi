# QNNPyPhi
A Python based library to Simulate the calculation of Phi (Integrated Information) on Neural Networks and even Quantum Neural Networks.
The library is in currently Development Phase.

The feature we have added and are planning to add are:
- Custom Node: Node is essentially an object, more than just a label. You can customize and store relevant information in it.
- Custom Edges: The edge is more than an edge weight. It's a flexible Python object.
- Generate Transition Probability Matrix: Given a directed graph structure representing a Finite State Machine, the library automatically generates a TPM of it (useful in Phi calculations in our case.)
